CMIND stands for C Memory Bug Inspection based on Neural Deduction and is developed by [apcl-research](https://github.com/apcl-research) at [University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/). It is specifically developed to localize memory bugs in C. CMIND is mainly tested on the ```o4-mini-2025-04-16``` and ```gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07``` models although you can change it to different models with cheaper/better options. You can refer to [Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.

The author of CMIND is [Chia-Yi Su](https://chiayisu.github.io/) and [Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/). We are commited to keep CMIND open source. If you cannot find anything or have any question, please contact us. 

The video demonstration for [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-demonstrations) is as follows.

## Key features

- **Human-like bug localizer**: Cmind is designed based on the human study from [Human Attention During Localization of Memory Bugs in C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00693).
- **Flexibility to submit bug report**: You can submit the bug report via our online website or deploy it in your local machines
- **Easy to retrieve results**: Cmind will return an ID after you submit the bug report. You can use this ID to submit bug report and source code  
- **Combined LLMs with guidance**: Cmind combines LLMs with guided decision making to avoid LLMs go off-track
