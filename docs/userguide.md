## Overview
One way to run CMIND is to submit your source code and bug report to a web-based submission form to our [Website](http://172.237.148.235/). The system will send you an ID when you submit the bug report and source code. You will need this code to retrive/download the results. 

If you want to run it locally, please refer to [Guide for command-line]({% link docs/configuration.md %}) on how to run it. 

{: .note }
Users are required to submit a `.zip` file that includes all of the source code, so the system can do the static analysis for more accurate results.
